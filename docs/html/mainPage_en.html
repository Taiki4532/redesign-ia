        <p class = "about_description">We are proud of the Department of Industrial Art, Faculty and Graduate School of System Design's unique pairing of product-related and media-related design disciplines within the Metropolitan University's science and engineering departments. Design is not just about creating form, but it's rather about playing an important role in the creation of new products and trends, which the creation is of the concept, it's architecture, or the production and integration of its application. Designers today must not only have specialist knowledge, but they must also be able to take initiative To achieve this, we encourage students to take interest in not only their own specialization, but also the wider world of science and technology, culture and social sciences, popular products and media, and utilize our facilities to explore new types of design by drawing on all of them. Our curriculum is based on : 4 years of departmental study followed by 2 years of hands-on professional specialization.</p>
